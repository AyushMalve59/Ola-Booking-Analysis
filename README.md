# Ola-Booking-Analysis
This end-to-end data analysis project explores Ola's ride-booking patterns to derive actionable business insights, leveraging a structured analytical workflow across multiple tools. The project begins with SQL for extracting and transforming raw booking data (cleaning null values, handling outliers, and joining tables), followed by Excel for preliminary analysis using pivot tables and statistical functions to identify baseline trends. The refined dataset is then visualized in Power BI, where interactive dashboards highlight key metrics like demand fluctuations by time/location, ride duration vs. pricing correlations, cancellation drivers, and customer segmentation. Advanced Power BI features (e.g., DAX measures, geospatial mapping, and drill-down filters) enable stakeholders to dynamically explore trends, such as peak-hour demand in urban centers or the impact of weather on booking frequency. The final insights aim to optimize Ola’s operational strategies—from dynamic pricing to driver allocation—while improving customer experience. The repository includes SQL scripts, processed Excel files, and Power BI reports with documentation for reproducibility.
